This is a project from the Codecademy Front-End Developer Career Path. In this project, you will build a React web application called Jammming. You will use your knowledge of React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

This is Unit 4/5 of the Front-End Developer Career Path.

Thank you for your support! Feel free to check in as I continue to build my developer skills.
